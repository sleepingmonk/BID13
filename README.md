# BID13 PHP Developer Quiz


## Question #1: Phone Number Validation

Dear Quizmaster,

When I did this quiz the link to your ChatGPT code in dpaste.com returned 404.

I put your prompt in ChatGPT myself, just for fun. It was useless. Instead I reviewed the docs for Telesign and used their PHP SDK. Please see `/src/phoneId/isValid.php` for details.

Because I could not view your pasted code to modify, I hope my commented code from scratch reveals many years of experience in PHP and Drupal. I've been Drupaling since 4.3 and coding in general since I was 8.

There were obviously other ways I could have structured this, but as it's a quick test, out of context with any larger codebase, I beleive this is sufficient to prove the point.  I'm happy to answer questions.

As for LLMs in my coding practice. I sometimes use copilot but mostly as a quick resource for looking for general answers to API questions or syntax. I tried code completion for a while, and it was eerily accurate on occassion, but much of the time it was just irritating. Now I just use the chat as a first pass to answer questions before I navigate to API docs.


## Question #2: Scatter Plot

I used GdImage. Again, as this is an out of context demo, it's just functional code. I made it robust enough to adapt to any x or y plot values whether positive or negative, and because I'm also adept at front end, I couldn't help but add some padding to the rendered image.

Once I realized what it was, I dispensed with drawing the x and y axes and had a banana. Though the banana I consumed had all it's y values in the positive orientation.

Thanks for the fun little challenges.
